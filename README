* Initial Readme *

This project was born out of necessity in that I needed the family
name of google fonts after I've added them to a private font collection 
that doesn't persist after application shutdown. Google font metadata
provides a family name but that's actually the preferred family name. 
Unfortunately, GDI+ (and most other APIs I've found) will not use this 
name for querying. I also have no way of fetching the family name through
GDI+ unfortunately. 

This is a pretty specific use case but if anyone feels they could use it, 
I wouldn't mind expanding the project past the scope of my personal use
case. Make an issue or suggestion if you want.
